## Project Details

### Opportunity

Develop an aesthetically pleasing restaurant website, following a detailed design in Figma.

### What I Did

- Built the frontend using Next.js with TypeScript for type safety.
- Used Tailwind CSS to expedite styling.
- Followed the design file from Figma, laid out a detailed plan, and executed it meticulously.

### Highlights

- **Sleek UI Design:** Offers an engaging user experience. The website's aesthetics are visually appealing, making it a restaurant I would definitely visit.
- **Reservation Booking Form:** Uses Resend to send the user a confirmation email.

### Challenges

- The design posed significant challenges, particularly in laying out the initial groundwork.
- Finding a suitable email service provider for reservations was a hurdle, but successfully integrated Resend and React Email. This resulted in a simple, beautiful, and functional product with continuous improvements being made.
